evplan - Event Planner
======================

This is a tool to help prepare an event in the line of conferences.
What I want from this tool is:

  - Generation of a schedule for all talks;
  - Use of tags to prevent same type of presentation in the same time;
  - Use of tags and room groups to put similar presentations together;
  - Creation of a site with all information;
  - Ability to work from windows and linux;
  - Possibility of integration with a GUI;
  - Creation of printed guides (manual?, how's this called?).

I think the easiest way to have this happen is using Python.
